My name is Mostafa Mohamed Shehata. I’m 19 years old and currently entering my second year at university, where I study Business Information Systems. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and plan to start a course in AI soon. After completing the course, I intend to apply for a job in the field. I’m also passionate about sports, especially MMA, and I aim to become a skilled MMA fighter one day.

In addition to my career and sports goals, I want to become a responsible and caring husband in the future. I’m working hard to succeed in life and to become a disciplined and committed person in my religion. I believe in continuous self-improvement and doing my best to grow in all areas of my life.
